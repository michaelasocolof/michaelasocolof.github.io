I am a PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at McGill University. My research interests are primarily in computational linguistics, psycholinguistics, and theoretical syntax and semantics. I approach research questions using a combination of computational modeling, experimental, and fieldwork methodologies. My dissertation focuses on formalizing compositionality using the information-theoretic framework of Partial Information Decomposition.

Beginning in September 2024, I will be an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT.
