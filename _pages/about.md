I recently received my PhD in Linguistics at McGill University. My research interests are primarily in computational linguistics, psycholinguistics, and theoretical syntax and semantics. I approach research questions using a combination of computational, experimental, and fieldwork methodologies. My dissertation proposes formalizing compositionality using the information-theoretic framework of Partial Information Decomposition.

Beginning in September 2024, I will be an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT.
