I am an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT, working in Dr. Roger Levy's Computational Psycholinguistics Lab. I received my PhD in Linguistics from McGill University.

My research interests are primarily in computational linguistics, psycholinguistics, and theoretical syntax and semantics. I approach research questions using a combination of computational, experimental, and fieldwork methodologies. My dissertation proposes formalizing compositionality using the information-theoretic framework of Partial Information Decomposition.
